# Applications of FDSLRM

10 Jupyter notebooks with real data set applications of FDSLRM, mainly in econometrics [![render in nbviewer](nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fdslrm/EBLUP-NE/blob/master/index.ipynb) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fdslrm/applications/master?filepath=index.ipynb) 
  
The notebooks folder ([`notebooks`](notebooks)) contain R based Jupyter notebooks which are detailed records of our computing 
with explaining narratives ilustrating explored concepts and methods. 

Notebooks can be studied and **viewed** statically in [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fdslrm/applications/blob/master/index.ipynb) [![render in nbviewer](nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fdslrm/applications/blob/master/index.ipynb) with full visualisation. If there is a need, they can be also viewed directly on Github [`index.ipynb`](index.ipynb), also as a raw code. 

For interactive **executing** notebooks as live documents without any need to install or compile the software,
**use** the following link [`Binder`](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fdslrm/applications/master?filepath=index.ipynb) - [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fdslrm/applications/master?filepath=index.ipynb)
